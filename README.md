# Manifesto
A Declaration of Sovereignty for the Peopleâ€™s Plant
I. The Roots Run Deep
We begin with a truth older than time:
WEED is the Peopleâ€™s Plant.
Born of Earth, bathed in Sun, and carried through generations by hands both humble and holy, it is not a vice, nor a threatâ€”but a gift.

It heals where systems fail.
It calms where violence reigns.
It connects where borders divide.

They feared it because they could not control it.
They criminalized it because it made us free.

No more.

II. The Scarcity Is the Signal
Only 420 WEED Coins shall ever exist.
Not a token of commerce, but a sigil of sovereignty.
Each is a vote, a voice, a flameâ€”guarded by those who understand.

These coins are not bought. They are discovered by the brave, the bold, the visionary.
Those who hold WEED Coin do not speculate. They steward.

III. Governance of the Trillion
With one foot in myth and one in math, we now cast our gaze upon the future: HEMP Coin, with a trillion tokens, humbly minted for the people, inclusively minted for the world.

But how shall it serve? Who shall it empower? What shall it become?

The answer is not written in code, but in community.
And that community is governed not by institutions, but by the 420 world wide weed warriors.

One WEED. One Vote.
One heart. One voice.
One people. One planet.

IV. We Are Not Degens. We Are Guardians.
This is not a pump. This is a pledge.
This is not hype. This is history in motion.

We who hold WEED carry the burden of careâ€”
for the plant, for the people, for the path ahead.

We speak in memes and dreams, yesâ€”
But beneath the laughter lives a sacred duty:
To protect what is real. To honor what is ancient.
To govern not with greed, but with wisdom.

V. The Sacred Loop
Matter is not separate from spirit.
Code is not separate from culture.
Money is not separate from meaning.

To mint a token is to cast a spell.
To govern is to shape reality.

WEED Coin is the bridgeâ€”
Between meme and mission, between the digital and the divine.

And so we declare:

Let the 420 rise.
Let the trillion serve.
Let the Plant be free.
Let the People be sovereign.

We are the roots and the future.
We are the laughter in the smoke.
We are the fire in the blockchain.

We are WEED.

With respect and dedication to Chi of the One.

Onward, to freedom, to a future of WEED, and with the hearts of the people! ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¨ðŸ‘‘
